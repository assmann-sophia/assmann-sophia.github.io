        <h4>What are orcinus orcas?</h4>
       <p>Orcinus orca, commonly known as the killer whale or orca, is a toothed whale belonging to the oceanic dolphin family, Delphinidae. They are highly social animals, often living in complex social structures known as pods. Orcas are apex predators, meaning they have no natural predators and are at the top of their food chain.</p>
       <p>Orcas are found in all oceans, from the frigid Arctic and Antarctic regions to tropical seas. They are known for their distinctive black and white coloring, with a white patch above and behind the eye and a white underside

        <h4>Fun Facts:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Some sources suggest that Orcinus means 'of the kingdom of the dead', butthe International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) mentions that the name orca originates from the Latin word orca, meaning 'a large-bellied pot.</li>
            <li>Orcas are often referred to as "killer whales" because ancient sailors saw them hunt larger whales. Since the 1960s, the term "orca" has increasingly replaced "killer whale" in common usage.</li>
            <li>Orcas are known for their sophisticated hunting techniques and vocal behaviors, which vary between different populations. They use echolocation to find and capture prey.</li>
            <li>Orcas are the largest members of the dolphin family</li>
